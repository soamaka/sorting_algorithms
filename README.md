* This project contains the implementation of several sorting algorithms using The C Programming Language __C__.

# The Implemented Algorithms

| Algorithm Name                                  | Description                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ['Bubble sort'](./Bubble%20sort)               |  Repeatedly compare and swap adjacent elements until the list is sorted. |
| ['Insertion sort'](./Insertion%20sort)         |  Build sorted list by inserting elements in the correct position.       |
| ['Selection sort'](./Selection%20sort)         |  Iteratively find and swap the smallest element to its correct position.|
| ['Quick sort'](./Quick%20sort)                 |  Recursively partition and sort elements.                                |
| ['Shell sort'](./Shell%20sort)                 |  Repeatedly sort subsets of elements using diminishing increment gaps.   |
| ['Cocktail shaker sort'](./Cocktail%20shaker%20sort) |  Repeatedly sort elements in both directions, like a shaking motion.  |
| ['Counting sort'](./Counting%20sort)           |  Categorize and arrange elements based on their count.                   |
| ['Merge sort'](./Merge%20sort)                 |  Divide and conquer by recursively merging sorted subarrays.             |
| ['Heap sort'](./Heap%20sort)                   |  Create a binary heap and repeatedly extract the maximum element to sort the array. |
| ['Bitonic sort'](./Bitonic%20sort)             |  Recursively divide the array into bitonic sequences and then compare and swap elements to create a sorted sequence. |
| ['Radix sort'](./Radix%20sort)                 |  Sort elements based on individual digits or characters, starting from the least significant position and moving towards the most significant position. |



# General
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
